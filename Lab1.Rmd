## Making Github Easier
1. Keep track of your change reasons so that when you come back to a project you can remember your changes. 
2. Make sure to leave a description when you submit a pull request so that the original developer knows what changes you made. 
3. Make sure to be careful when you merge so that you dont accidentally mess up the original code
